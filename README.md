# Heart_Failure_Prediction-using-ANN
This project aims to develop a system to automatically detect heart failure prediction.

Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) have emerged as a powerful tool in the field of medical diagnostics, offering a promising approach for predicting heart failure.

ANNs are computational models inspired by the human brain's network of neurons. 

They are capable of learning from data, identifying complex patterns, and making predictions.

In the context of heart failure prediction, ANNs can analyze a vast array of clinical data, including patient demographics, medical history, laboratory results, and imaging data, to identify patterns indicative of heart failure.

unlike machine learning models we use neural networks for predicting the haert failures.

In this project, we employed an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to predict heart failure using the "Heart Failure Clinical Reports" dataset from Kaggle.

The model achieved an accuracy of 75.98%, demonstrating a reasonable predictive capability for identifying patients at risk of heart failure. 
While the results are promising, there is room for improvement through techniques such as hyperparameter tuning, feature engineering, and incorporating additional data. 
Further research and model refinement could enhance the accuracy and reliability of the predictions, making ANN a valuable tool in clinical decision-making and early intervention for heart failure.
